[Plait Language](https://docs.racket-lang.org/plait/index.html) has
some good info on design decisions that make a type system in Lisp a
little bit better.

[Typing Haskell in Haskell](https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/thih/thih.pdf) The implentation of Hindley-Milner in Typing Haskell in Haskell was ported to common lisp and serves as the base of coalton's type system.

[Type classes: an exploration of the design space](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/1997/01/multi.pdf) This paper guided the typeclass implementation in Coalton.

[Elm Lang](https://elm-lang.org/) Elm's runtime currying system directly inspired the model used for function application in Coalton.

[Type Inference for Haskell by Jeremy Mikkola](https://jeremymikkola.com/posts/2019_01_01_type_inference_intro.html) Jeremy's blog series was very helpful for understanding some of the more intricate parts of THIH.

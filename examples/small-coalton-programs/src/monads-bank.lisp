;;;;
;;;; This example program uses the classic bank account management example
;;;; to demonstrate how multiple monads can be combined together to manage
;;;; complex effects.
;;;;
;;;; In this program, you can create and close bank accounts with different
;;;; names and balances. You can transfer money between different accounts.
;;;; There is a configurable minimum balance that must be floated in an
;;;; account at all times. Overdraft protection can either be on or off,
;;;; blocking withdrawals below the minimum balance; otherwise, an account
;;;; in the minimum balance cannot be used except in a deposit.
;;;;
;;;; To manage all of the state, context, and possible failures, we combine
;;;; the state monad (to manage our state), the environment monad (to manage
;;;; our static configuration), and the Result monad (to stop running the
;;;; program whenever we encounter an error).
;;;;
;;;; To completely understand the workings of this example program, it will
;;;; be helpful to already have a basic grasp of how the State, Environment,
;;;; and Result monads work.
;;;;

;;;
;;; Bank Example
;;;

;;; First, we set up the types that will store all of the data. We alias
;;; a few primitive types to make type signatures more expressive and set
;;; up structs to store our program's Configuration and the data for an
;;; individual account.

(coalton-toplevel
  (define-type-alias AccountName String)
  (define-type-alias Balance Integer)
  (define-type-alias Amount Integer)

  (define-struct Configuration
    (minimum-balance      "Minimum balance that must be floated by an account."                          Balance)
    (overdraft-protection "If True, prevents an account from being withdrawn below the minimum balance." Boolean))

  (declare without-overdraft-protection (Configuration -> Configuration))
  (define (without-overdraft-protection conf)
    (Configuration (.minimum-balance conf) False))

  (define-struct Account
    (name    AccountName)
    (balance Balance))

  (declare add-balance (Amount -> Account -> Account))
  (define (add-balance amount acc)
    (Account (.name acc) (+ (.balance acc) amount)))

  (declare subtract-balance (Amount -> Account -> Account))
  (define (subtract-balance amount acc)
    (Account (.name acc) (- (.balance acc) amount))))

;;; Second, we set up the type that is going to represent the top-level state
;;; of our whole program. We decided that our configuration will be loaded
;;; statically, so it won't need to be part of our state. We'll store a map
;;; from AccountName -> Account as our program's state, and call that `BankState`.
;;; For now, this is still just an immutable type! We'll get into actual state
;;; management later.

(coalton-toplevel
  (define-type-alias BankState (m:OrdMap AccountName Account))

    (lisp :a ()
      (cl:format cl:t "--------~%"))
    Unit))

;;; Third, we'll set up an error type to store all of the ways that our program
;;; could go wrong. `BankResult` is a handy alias for `(Result BankError :value)`.
;;; So, for example, a `(BankResult Integer)` type is either a failure (`BankError`)
;;; or a success (`Integer`).

  (define-type BankError
    (AccountAlreadyExists  AccountName)
    (InvalidDeposit        Amount)

;;; Fourth, we set up our application's monad. We know that we need to store state, so
;;; we want to have a State (`ST`) monad. But we also want to store our static configuration,
;;; so we want to use the Environment (`EnvT`) monad. We can get both of these features in one
;;; type by wrapping `ST` in an `EnvT`, which we do in this type alias. `BankM`, or "BankMonad",
;;; will be where we run all of our complex domain logic that needs to be able to read and write
;;; to our `BankState` and read our `Configuration`.
;;;
;;; By using `EnvT Configuration`, we're telling it which type to use for the Environment
;;; functions. By using `ST BankState`, we're telling it which type to use for the State functions.
;;; Combined, our `BankM` will be able to function as both a ST and an EnvT monad.
;;;
;;; Finally, the type alias leaves off the value parameter. So a `BankM :val` represents a
;;; computation in our overall bank context (state + configuration) that returns a type of :val.

     ;; still performing a "side effect" by modifying the state in our BankM monad.

;;; Finally, we'll create all of the functions that our "user" can use to
;;; manipulate their accounts directly. Note that, at the very top level of our

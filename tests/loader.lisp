;;;; This package contains the function LOAD-TEST-FILE for loading
;;;; parser tests from specially formatted files.
;;;;
;;;; The format is:
;;;;
;;;;     ======
;;;;     <header>
;;;;     ======
;;;;     <program>
;;;;     ------
;;;;     <error message>
;;;;       or
;;;;     <empty string, to assert that the program must compile without error>
;;;;     ======
;;;;     <header 2>
;;;;     ...
;;;;
;;;; The first sequence of one or more consecutive numeric characters
;;;; in the test header will be interpreted as a test number, for
;;;; reexecution of single tests.
;;;;
;;;; There are examples in tests/parser-test-files/*.txt
;;;;
;;;; Use
;;;;
;;;;     (load-test-file #<pathname>)
;;;;
;;;; to load tests,
;;;;
;;;;     (run-test-file #<pathname>)
;;;;
;;;; to run tests, and
;;;;
;;;;     (run-test #<pathname> N)
;;;;
;;;; to run a single numbered test without condition handlers.
;;;;
;;;; RUN-TEST-FILE and RUN-TEST are defined in tests/utilities.lisp

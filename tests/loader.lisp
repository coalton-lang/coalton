;;;; This package contains the function LOAD-TEST-FILE for loading
;;;; parser tests from specially formatted files.
;;;;
;;;; - The format is documented in tests/test-files/README.md
;;;; - Tests are defined in tests/test-files/*.txt
;;;; - These tests are loaded and run by tests/coalton-tests.lisp
;;;; - COALTON-TESTS:RUN-TEST-FILE and COALTON-TESTS:RUN-TEST are
;;;;   defined in tests/utilities.lisp
;;;;
;;;; To execute a single suite:
;;;;
;;;;   (coalton-tests:run-test-file #<pathname>)
;;;;
;;;; To run a single numbered test without condition handlers:
;;;;
;;;;   (coalton-tests:run-test #<pathname> N)

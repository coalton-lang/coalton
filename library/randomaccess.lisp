;;; Class Implementation
(coalton-toplevel
  ;; The decision to use a functional dependency was an ergonomic one,
  ;; not a technical one. If we did not establish this dependency, we
  ;; would win flexibility (a single storage type can store multiple
  ;; data types), but we would lose a lot of practical ergonomics
  ;; (e.g., we would need Proxy types, calls to length would need to be
  ;; disambiguated, etc.).
  ;;
  ;; While we lose some flexibility, we still retain some. For
  ;; instance, we can have multiple storage types for double floats
  ;; (think: Lisp arrays, C arrays, GPU arrays, etc.).

It is permitted for any of `make`, `unsafe-aref`, or `unsafe-set!` to error."

## `coalton-library/experimental`

This directory contains packages which are designated "experimental."
These packages provide useful functionality which may later be
implemented at a lower level or redesigned for improved syntax and
developer experience. For example,
`coalton-library/experimental/loops` provides a bare-bones `named-let`
macro, which will very likely to be added to Coalton at the compiler
level, next to `let`, `when`, and other similar constructs.

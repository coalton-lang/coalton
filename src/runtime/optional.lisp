;;;; optional.lisp
;;;;
;;;; This package contains the underlying implementation of the
;;;; Optional type for Coalton. The idea is to avoid unnecessary
;;;; boxing by defining a structure that represents None nested in N
;;;; Somes. Consider the general case of the type (Optional^M :t). In
;;;; this case, we have exactly M+1 possible cases to match
;;;; against. We have the cases (Some^N (None)) for N from 0 to M-1
;;;; and we have the case (Some^M x) where x is of type :t. Therefore,
;;;; by defining a struct CL-OPTIONAL with one slot, DEPTH, we can
;;;; always represent (Optional^M :t) as either an element of type :t
;;;; or as a CL-OPTIONAL with a depth between 0 and M-1.
;;;;
;;;; For example, (lisp (Optional (Optional :t)) () 5) is
;;;; unambiguously equal to (Some (Some 5)).

;;; When typechecking bindings with fundeps, there can be unambiguous

;;;       m :: :a -> :b
;;;
;;; The following is a valid definition:
;;;

;;;
;;; However if f had a type declaration like:

;;;     f :: C :a :b :c => :a -> :b
;;;
;;; Then its inferred predicates would need to be checked against its
;;; declared predicates. Because the class variable :c is not used
;;; anywhere, the declaration of f's type and the invocation of "m"
;;; would chose different type variables for :c. This would then error
;;; because "C :a :b :c" does not `entail' "C :a :b :d".
;;;
;;; The function `fundep-entail' takes a list of declared predicates,
;;; a list of inferred predicates, and a list of known type variables.
;;; It then finds inferred predicates that would match declared
;;; predicates if not for differing unknown types at identical
;;; indices.
;;;
;;; The other requirement is that unknown types must be within the
;;; "transitive `closure'" of the known types.

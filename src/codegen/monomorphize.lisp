;;;; src/codegen/monomorphize.lisp
;;;;
;;;; Recompile specialized versions of type class generic functions across a call graph.
;;;;
;;;; The monomorphizer works by traversing a callgraph, it starts at a
;;;; given entrypoint and looks up the optimized AST associated with that
;;;; entrypoint. The function CANDIDATE-SELECTION then finds function
;;;; applications within that entrypoint that are being passed
;;;; statically known typeclass dictionaries. These application sites
;;;; and their arguments are referred to as "compile candidates".
;;;;
;;;; (declare (Num :a => :a -> :a))
;;;; (define (f x)
;;;;   (+ 1 2)               <- Addition on "Integer"
;;;;   (+ (Some x) (Some x)) <- Addition on "Optional :a"
;;;;   (+ x x)               <- Addition on ":a"
;;;;
;;;; In the above example only the first function application is a
;;;; valid candidate. The later calls to + do not have statically
;;;; known dictionaries. SOME has no typeclass dictionaries and thus
;;;; is also not a valid candidate.
;;;;
;;;; Candidates are comprised of a function name, which currently must
;;;; be defined at the top level. And a list of arguments which can be
;;;; nodes or the placeholder value '@@unpropagated. Unpropagated
;;;; values will remain as function arguments in the recompiled
;;;; version of a function. Valid candidates have at least two
;;;; arguments, at least one argument must not be '@@unpropagated, and
;;;; they must have at least one unpropagated argument.
;;;; 
;;;; Valid candidates can have unknown typeclass dictionaries as long
;;;; as at least one argument is a valid dictionary. Candidates are
;;;; each given a unique name, used as the name of their recompiled
;;;; function. Candidates are only recompiled once per callgraph, but
;;;; the same function may be recompiled many times with different
;;;; static dictionaries as arguments. Candidate recompilation can
;;;; also be deduplicated across multiple monomorphized callgraphs in
;;;; the same compilation unit.

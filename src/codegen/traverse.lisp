  "The intended use case of `traverse` is to recursively propagate an
operation through the AST when only a few nodes need custom behavior,
obviating the need to copy an entire `defgeneric` for each new AST
traversal. This function creates a recursive \"generic\" traversal
with pre-, in-, and post-operations fixed by `custom-actions` (with
the default traversals as a fallback), and evaluates the traversal
with `initial-node` and `initial-args`. The `:before` and `:after` are
mainly useful if the default deep-copy recursion behavior is desired,
but a small change has to be made depending on the node type, or if
some external state is mutated to keep track of some information about
the recursion stack. The `:before 'node` and `:after 'node` actions
may also be useful for operations that must be performed uniformly on
every node, such as type collection and substitution. The `:traverse`
action is necessary if special traversal behavior is required, such as
recursing with modified arguments.

Note that the wrapped traversal pipes the node through three actions
corresponding to its original class, so it is important to not define
any node-specific actions that will run after another action which may
return a node of a different type. For example, if there is an action
on `:traverse 'node-variable` to substitute variables with arbitrary
other nodes, then it would be inappropriate to also define an action
`:after 'node-variable`."

Using SBCL 2.5.11.72-d1e9d67be (git clone, make isntall) now. Deleted debian sbcl, to no longer have conflicts.
Also updated the Makefile (in a previous commit), to ensure that all rules use the same sbcl binary.

And testing it with:

sbcl --non-interactive \
     --eval '(ql:quickload :coalton)' \
     --eval '(cl:format t "XXXSTEP1~%")' \
     --eval '(ql:quickload :coalton/tests)' \
     --eval '(cl:format t "XXXSTEP2~%")' \
     --eval '(asdf:test-system :coalton)' \
     --eval '(cl:format t "XXXSTEP3~%")'

Followed by:
sbcl --non-interactive \
     --eval '(asdf:test-system :coalton)' \
     --eval '(cl:format t "XXXSTEP3~%")'

And by calling make cleanall test.

1) BUG (?):
Macro with-muffled-code-deletion-note-condition-if-possible now causes compilation errors. Are these due to a bug in the macro or are there instances where there are reachable cases that have not been considered?

2) Not considered yet:
src/runtime/function-entry.lisp: sbcl-specific code is different from what appears in the other files.  (declaim (sb-ext:start-block ,@funs)) / (declaim (sb-ext:end-block))
src/typechecker/kinds.lisp: sbcl-specific code is different from what appears in the other files. (declaim (sb-ext:always-bound *next-kvar-id*))
src/typechecker/types.lisp: sbcl-specific code is different from what appears in the other files. (declaim (sb-ext:always-bound *next-variable-id*))
library/classes.lisp: sbcl-specific code is different from what appears in the other files. (repr :native (cl:unsigned-byte 62)) / (cl:error "hashing is not supported on ~A" (cl:lisp-implementation-type))

3) Not sensible to touch:
library/big-float/impl-sbcl.lisp: the whole file is sbcl-specific, so doesn't make sense to try to make it "compatible".

4) Needs design first:
library/system.lisp: the condition involves coalton code as well:
  (define (monotonic-bytes-consed)
    "Returns the number of bytes consed since some unspecified point in time.

The difference between two successive calls to this function represents the number of bytes consed in that period of time."
    #+sbcl
    (Some (lisp Integer ()
            (sb-ext:get-bytes-consed)))
    #-sbcl
    None)
